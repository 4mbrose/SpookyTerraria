Hello and welcome to Spooky Terraria!

THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE. EVERYTHING IS DUE TO ISSUE.
PLEASE LET ME KNOW ON DISCORD BY CLICKING ON THE HOMEPAGE LINK.

First of all, this was inspired by both Fundy on YouTube and Slenderman: the 8 pages.
This mod is still a work in progress, so nothing is final.

BE SURE TO CREATE A NEW CHARACTER WITH THIS MOD ENABLED FIRST.

In this mod, your world gets a whole lot darker and creepier, along with a new NPC, the Stalker.
The stalker is a high stealth creature who can attack you when you least expect it, so be sure to use your flashlight accordingly.
The one way you will know the Stalker is near you is a heartbeat. Your heartbeat links to the Stalker. The faster your heartbeat gets, the closer you are.
Another thing: Heartrate is now an important factor in the mod.
If your heartrate goes above 240, you die.

Some extra spooky things like ambience have been added!
In the forest you can hear crickets, owls, and eerie winds.

At the ocean, you can hear crashing waves, which are loud.

In the snow, you can hear faint snowfall.

A NOTE TO ALL: This is intended for SINGLE PLAYER GAMEPLAY.
Playing multiplayer can result in client sided issues like the flashlight not doing what it is supposed to,
heads rotating incorrectly, or Stalkers not spawning properly. So if you choose to play multiplayer, this is what will happen to you.
